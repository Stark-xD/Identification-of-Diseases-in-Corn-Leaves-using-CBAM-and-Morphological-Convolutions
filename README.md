# Corn is one of the major food crops in India along with wheat and rice. Considering that different diseases might have different treatments, incorrect detection can lead to incorrect remedial measures. Although CNN based models have been used for classification tasks, we aim to classify similar looking disease manifestations with a higher accuracy compared to the one obtained by existing deep learning methods. We have evaluated ensembles of CNN based image features, with a ResNet50 neural network in order to achieve leaf disease classification and for extracting features we have used Convolution Block Attention Module. We have achieved 93.03% accuracy in our model.
